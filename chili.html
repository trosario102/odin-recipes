    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meaty Tofu Crumbles</li>
        <li>Sweet Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Crushed Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Black Beans</li>
        <li>Kidney Beans</li>
        <li>Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, nutritional yeast, chili powder and smoked paprika. It will be
            pasty. Now crumble the tofu into the bowl with your hands, and mix together using a large spoon until well
            combined with the paste.</li>
        <li>Spread the tofu mixture evenly in the pan. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, stirring the tofu
            halfway through. Once the tofu is in the oven, start the chili.</li>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil. Add the chopped onion and sauté 3-4 minutes until
            translucent. Add in the garlic and cook 1 more minute, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Now add all the rest of the chili ingredients, except the tofu, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then
            lower the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the tofu crumbles are done baking. </li>
        <li>If a thicker consistency is desired, use an immersion blender and blend just a few times. Do this before you
            add the tofu.</li>
        <li>Once the tofu crumbles are done, stir them into the pot. All done! Serve with vegan sour cream, cornbread,
            tortilla chips, cilantro, tomatoes, hot sauce, vegan cheese shreds and chives, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

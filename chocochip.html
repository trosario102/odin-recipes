    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Everybody has their go-to, tried and true chocolate chip cookie recipe, right? Well, I used to before going vegan
        and since then itâ€™s been hit or miss. I have tried countless recipes over the years, and some have been pretty
        good but I had yet to find the PERFECT recipe I was looking for. Until now.</p>

    <h1>Amazing Fudgy Vegan Brownies</h1>
    <p>Finally, just a few days ago, I made one more batch of vegan brownies, after carefully creating the recipe on
        paper. I was SO excited as the batter tasted incredible, and after baking they looked good in the pan. Still
        having doubts, I let them cool a bit and then removed them from the pan and sliced them slowly.</p>
    <p>When I looked inside and took the first bite, I knew, I had finally created the PERFECT Vegan Brownies Recipe!
        They are thick and hold together when you slice them. Fudgy, but not overly so, chewy, rich, ooey-gooey and full
        of chocolatey goodness. No one would guess theyâ€™re vegan!</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Flax</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Vegan Butter</li>
        <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
        <li>Non-dairy chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the flax eggs by stirring the ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to thicken. Preheat the
            oven to 350 degrees F and line a 7 x 11 pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Melt the vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), and measure 1/2 cup. I do this by microwaving the
            vegan butter in a glass measuring cup, in 30 second intervals, until melted.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the melted vegan butter and sugars together. Add the flax eggs and vanilla, whisk
            until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Over the same large bowl, sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Add the salt and baking powder and stir with a
            large wooden spoon until just combined, do not over mix. </li>
        <li>Fold in half of the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top with a
            spoon or your hands. Sprinkle the rest of the chocolate chips on top of the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes. The brownies may still be bubbling and not look done, but they will firm up a lot as
            they cool.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then pull the brownies out, using the
            parchment paper and let cool for another 15-30 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
